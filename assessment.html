    <strong>The Denver Nuggets</strong> are an American professional basketball team based in Denver.
    The Nuggets compete in the National Basketball Association (NBA) as a member of the league's
    Western Conference Northwest Division. The team was founded as the Denver Larks in 1967 as a
    charter franchise of the American Basketball Association (ABA), but changed their name to Rockets
    before the first season.The Rockets then changed their name again to the Nuggets in 1974.
    After the name change, the Nuggets played for the final ABA Championship title in 1976,
    losing to the New York Nets.

      <em><strong>1969-1976 ABA years: </strong>Playing at the Denver Auditorium Arena,
        the Rockets had early successes on the court, developing a strong fan base along the way
        However, the team had a history of early playoff exits and only once played in the ABA
        championship series.

        Early, Denver had a solid lineup led by Byron Beck and Larry Jones, then later by Beck
        and Ralph Simpson. Lonnie Wright of the American Football League's Denver Broncos signed
        with the Rockets during that first season and became the first player to play professional
        football and basketball in the same season. Wright played four seasons with Denver.[20]
        Controversial rookie Spencer Haywood joined the team for the 1969–70 season.
        Haywood was one of the first players to turn pro before graduating from college,
        and the NBA initially refused to let him play in the league. Haywood averaged nearly
        30 points and 19.5 rebounds per game in his only ABA season, being named ABA MVP,
        ABA rookie of the year, as well as the All-Star Game MVP. The team finished 51–33,
        winning their division, before exiting the playoffs in the 2nd round.

        Just before the start of the 1970–71 season, Haywood signed with the Seattle SuperSonics,
        jumping to the NBA. The team tumbled to a 30–54 record and attendance suffered.[20] </em>

      <strong>2015–present: The Nikola Jokić era.</strong> In the 2020-21 NBA season,
      Jokić was named the NBA Most Valuable Player becoming the first center to win the award
      since Shaquille O'Neal in 2000, as well as the first player in Nuggets franchise history.
      He also became the first Serbian player, third European player overall
      (along with Dirk Nowitzki of Germany and Giannis Antetokounmpo of Greece)
      and sixth international player to ever win the award (along with Hakeem Olajuwon of Nigeria,
      Tim Duncan of the U.S. Virgin Islands, Steve Nash of Canada, Dirk Nowitzki of Germany, and
      Giannis Antetokounmpo of Greece). Jokić also became the lowest ever drafted player at #41,
      and the first player in NBA history to be selected in the second round of the common era
      draft to win the MVP award.
